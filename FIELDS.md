# Custom Fields

Custom fields can be added to users to store additional information, such as whether or not the user has completed a form. This plugin
offers some enhanced behaviour when certain fields are found, such as the `fob` field. To add a field, log in to your aMember Pro admin
section and navigate to "Configuration" then "Add User Fields".
